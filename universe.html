<h2> OUR UNIVERSE-IT'S ORIGIN: </h2>

<hr size="4" noshade>
<h3> INTRODUTION:</h3>

<p>   “The idea that space and time may form a closed surface without boundary also has profound impllications for the role of god in the affairs of the universe…So  long as the universe had a beginning,we could suppose it had a creator.But if the universe is really completely self-contained,having no boundary or edge,it would have neither beginning nor the end:it would simple be.What place,then,for a creator?”   <b>-Stephen Hawking on the origin and the fate of the universe.(A Brief History of Time) </b> </p> 

<li>        According to Stephen Hawking and Hartle universe might be created from the absolute vacuum.This argument of Stephen Hawking is not in agreement with the classical theism.But the modern Quantum Cosmology can give more believable explanation the Hot Big Bang and such other therories,than those given by theism.Acoording to Big Bang theory the universe was ceated from a physical “singularity”.At singularity all the physical laws broke doen and from such a situation one cannot predict,what will evolve from it.Moreover,such a singularity cannot be easily explaned also.Hence Hawking eliminated the singularity at the origin and considered that the universe was created in a non-singularity physical conditions. </li>

<li>            There is a universal law,which is equally acceptable to both Eastern and Western philosophies that “matter can neither be created nor be destroyed”.This law,stated by the Issac Newton 3 centuries ago and presently by the Stephen Hawking in his Quantum Cosmology,had already been stated many centuries ago in the lines of Bhagavath Gita also.“That which has no entity has no standing.That which doesn’t have standing never evolves.That which has standing will never perish”.</li>

      <h2> BIG BANG THEORY:</h2>

      <li> According to George  Gamow,nearly 15 billion years ago[BYA] our universe came into existence from a sudden explosion.The entire matter,energy,space and time were simultaneousely created in this phenomenon known as Big Bang.It is believed that,all on a sudden,that is in one in million million fraction of a second [10^-12 sec] the universe expanded to a size equal to the present size of our solar system,from a pure vacuum state. At that state the universe had a temperature of 10 million million [10^13] kelvin.and the density 10^14gm/cc,which is 100 million million [10^14] the density of the water.The basic concept of the universe is that,fron the very beginning of the creation of the universe,it expanded continuously and correspondingly cooled down.</li>

      <li> The Big Bang Theory explains the evolution of universe through different stages in the order of events.It is theoretically  believed that from the begghining of the time until 10^-43 seconds[Plank time],all the 4 fundamental forces namely Gravitational,Electromagnetic,Strong Nuclear and Weak Nuclear forces jointely acted as a single unified force.At the end of Plank time Gravitational force separated from the other forces.</li>

      <h4> FOUR ERAS OF BIG BANG THEORY: BASED ON THE INFLUENCE AND THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE CONSTITUENT MATERIALS</h4>

      <ol> 
        <li> <strong>HADRONIC ERA </li>
        <li> LEPTONIC ERA </li>
        <li> RADIATIVE ERA </li>
        <li> STELLAR ERA </li> </strong>
        
        <P> Now lets discuss each one of them separately, </P>

        <hr size="4" noshade>

        <h5> 01.HADRONIC ERA:</h5> <p>The first 10^-4 seconds (means divide 1 second into 10,000 times) duration  since the creation of the universe is in Hadronic Era .This is known because,during this period the physical properties of the universe is determined by the hadrons such as Pi mesons,protons,neutrons and other heavy elementary particles.Then the average temperature and the density of the universe is 10^10 kelvin and 10^4 gm/cc respectively.</p>
       
        <h5>02.LEPTONIC ERA:</h5> Within next 10 seconds this era got ended.During that period the physical properties of the universe were determined by the Leptons(the electrons and positrons) which were in equilibrium with the radiative energy .Though at the beginning of the Leptonic era the neutrons were stable,at the end of it they lost there stability due to the  loss of lepton-radiation equilibrium and thereby decayed into  protons,neutrons and anti-neutrinos.At the end of this era the temperature and density of the universe were 10^10 kelvin and 10^4 gm/cc respectively.

        <h5> 03.RADIATIVE ERA:</h5> This era continued for 1 million years.The physical properties of the universe during this Era were controlled by the carriers of electromagnetic energy -the protons.At the beginning of this Era when the neutrons started decaying,a primordial nucleosynthesis started and continued until an  energy level was reached where the the photons cannot ionize hydrogen atom any further.It is under this cicumstances,the protons and electrons joined to form hydrogen atoms.Since the temperature then was 10^4 kelvin and the density was lowered to 10^-21gm/cc the universe became tansparent and then began the Stellar Era.

        <h4>04.STELLAR ERA:</h4> It lasts about 14 billion years,and it still continues.The temperature and the density of the universe have reduced very much during this Era.At present,the background temperature is only 2.7 kelvin and the density is merely 10^-30gm/cc.The special feature of this Era is that during this period the universe was formed as a well organised system with Galaxies and Stars,through a series of ordered processes.
      
      </ol>

      <h4> CONCLUSION:</h4> We are able to study our universe upto the Radiative Era.since the entire matter in the universe was in the stage of ionised.The Galaxies and the Stars which we see now couldn't have been there during that period or earlier.Another reason we got a chance to study this Era because this lasts about 1 million years.The conditions of the universe earlier  to this limit,were inferred only on the basis of hypothesis in nuclear physics.
